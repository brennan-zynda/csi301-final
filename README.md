Components
	I chose to omit components from the project purely due to my inexperience with Javascript/Typescript and React. For me, the project was much simpler to tackle or comprehend without implementing external components.
	
Hooks
	useState hooks were added to the setText and setTexts functions, which are called whenever a button is pressed. These ensure the project is updating whenever the user is inputting data or interacting with buttons on-screen.
